# Project Description
This repo provides a simple class for rescale images and annotations (in Pascal VOC format).
After the images and annotations are rescaled, they will be stored under the new folders. This
is usually helpful in some object detection tasks, where the images are too large and need to be
rescaled to smaller sizes first.
